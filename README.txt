Project 3
Riley Fewell

During this project I found that most of the instructions
where straight forward but the work its self requirred an 
understanding of what needs to ne done. It took some thinking
and drawing for me to truly understand what I need to do. The
hardest part for me was understanding what values need to be
stored in what variables. For example, I had a hard time
understanding what values needed to be stored in the right
and bottom variable. Other than that it took awhile to figure
out the equations for the vertical and horizontal lines and
also the equations for the door spaces. Once I sat down and 
drew out what really needs to be done and understood where
these things needed to be done I found that it made it much 
easier. I liked this project the most because we actually got to work with equations we were able to do something other than
text manipulation.
